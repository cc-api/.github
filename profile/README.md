# Welcome to Confidential Computing API Group

The CC (Confidential Computing) API Group is a community of people interested in
the innovation to accelerate the adoption of confidential computing technology
in cloud environments. It serves as a central gathering place for specs, documentation, and ideas.

Goals:
    
- Define unified and vendor agnostic API for cloud workloads running on diverse TEE vendors.
- Provide solutions of both node level and container level measurement gathering for workloads to complete remote attestation or other verification based on the measurements.
- Support measurement gathering in multiple deployment flavors of cloud workloads.
- Provide tools for building trust chain in confidential computing environments.
- Work as information hub of diver deployment flavors of confidential computing cloud environments.


## Getting Started

- [CCNP Quick Start](https://github.com/cc-api/confidential-cloud-native-primitives/blob/main/deployment/README.md) of preparing CVM guest image, creating CVM, gathering measurement and eventlogs for containers.
- [CC Measure](https://github.com/cc-api/cc-measure) - CLI tools of gathering measurement, eventlogs and verifying eventlogs for CVM. 
- [CVM Image Rewriter](https://github.com/cc-api/cvm-image-rewriter) - Create and customize the confidential VM's qcow2 image including IMA policy, initrd, device permission etc.
- [CC Cloud Automation](https://github.com/cc-api/cc-cloud-automation) - Automation framework & tools which supporting diverse confidential cloud flavors like confidential VM/cluster/container/FaaS etc.
